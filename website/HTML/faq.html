                                <h3>How does Ethbet return a profit if there is no house edge?</h3>
                                <p class="margin-b-5">Not all bets can be guaranteed to have a house edge of zero.
                                Ethbet allows players to set their own house edge and takes a small cut of this house
                                edge as long as it is not zero. This value is decided by the Ethbet token holders, which
                                    can also decide to charge minor fees for bet execution. As Ethbet matures as a platform
                                    there may be many additional opportunities for novel profit models as it acquires a
                                    larger market share.</p>

                                will last for only four weeks. See the <a href="https://crowdsale.ethbet.io/">crowdsale</a> page for more

                                <h3>What is the purpose of the Ethbet Token (EBET)?</h3>
                                <p class="margin-b-5">Ethbet token holders possess the currency that powers the Ethbet protocol. As Ethbet gains more users, market incentives will cause its currency to appreciate in value. Ethbet token holders are also able to vote on proposals to improve Ethbet. Token holders can vote on values such as what Ethbet's cut of its optional player-defined house edge should be or what future projects Ethbet should pursue, allowing them to steer the platform in the direction that is most profitable.

                                <h3>Why would users decide to use Ethbet over its competitors?</h3>
                                <p class="margin-b-5">Ethbet will be able to offer a house edge lower than all
                                competitors, which generally offer house edges only as low as 1%. This should cause all
                                players that wish to maximize their expected gain to rationally pick Ethbet over
                                less-profitable alternatives.</p>

                                will be deleted so that token dilution does not occur</p>

                                blockchain, all bets are public, however users can use Ethbet from any address that they
                                have control over, providing anonymity for users that desire it.</p>

                                <p class="margin-b-5">Ethbet relies on technology such as the Ethereum blockchain in order
                                to function properly. It cannot be guaranteed that zero bugs exist in Ethereum or in
                                Ethbet. With that said, Ethbet game smart contracts will undergo extensive security
                                audits before
                                they are deployed on the mainnet, ensuring that the probability of security-critical bugs
                                being deployed is as close to zero as possible.</p>

                                <h3>How well will Ethbet be able to scale?</h3>
                                <p class="margin-b-5">This depends on the state of the Ethereum network in the
                                future. Blockchain applications with a significant amount of users may find difficulty
                                scaling while maintaining low fees with the current state of Ethereum. There are many
                                scheduled improvements to Ethereum's scalability and efficiency, such as proof of stake,
                                Raiden, sharding, and others. It is our hope that these improvements are eventually
                                implemented and will allow blockchain applications to scale according to demand. In addition
                                to this, some parts of Ethbet such as matchmaking do not need to be on-chain, allowing for
                                much quicker and cheaper user interaction.</p>

                                <p class="margin-b-5"> Online gambling is illegal and/or regulated in many jurisdictions. Although
                                participating in the Ethbet crowdsale is very dissimilar from traditional online
                                gambling, we cannot make a guarantee that it is or will be considered legal in your
                                jurisdiction. As technologies such as blockchain decentralization, smart contracts, and
                                many others
                                are very new, there is no well-defined answer to this question, and there likely will
                                not be one soon. Investors from the United States are not permitted to invest during the crowdsale.</p>

                                token will be transferable after the crowdsale regardless of exchange adoption, so it

                                <p class="margin-b-5">
                                    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies many blockchain assets
                                    such as digital tokens or cryptocurrencies as securities. In order to sell a security
                                    to a United States resident, it must be registered with the SEC. This is a lengthy
                                    and costly process which we do not believe to be in our best interests.
                                    In addition to this, there are many other potential legal complications and uncertainties
                                    in the United States.
                                    For these reasons we are unable to offer our crowdsale to investors from the United States.

                                <h3>Why is there no team page? </h3>
                                <p class="margin-b-5">At this moment, this website features no 'team' page. Many ICOs
                                have resorted to significantly exaggerating or lying about their team members in order
                                to deceive investors. We're not going to join in on this, so you will not see a team page where we
                                list 30 ex-CEO and PhD members with titles like 'Executive Marketing Analyst' and 10 advisors including Vitalik himself. Our team consists only
                                of a few permaneant technical members, and other temporary members, such as those contracted
                                to help with graphics, marketing, legal, etc., which we do not consider members of the team due to their lack of formal affiliation with us.
                                    We only have two developers, which should be sufficient as this project is much smaller than many modern ICOs are.
                                    Maybe if we were more attractive it would be
                                worth enscribing our faces into circles and plastering them up with fancy-sounding titles,
                                but we instead hope that our project valuation is based off of its market potential and
                                merit rather than a shiny but deceptive team page. </p>

                                <p>There are a lot of differences between the goals of Edgeless and Ethbet. Edgeless
                                    does claim to offer blockchain gambling with no house edge, however there are many drawbacks:
                                </p>
                                    <ul>
                                <li>Edgeless does not offer a dice game with 0% house edge. Although they have a dice
                                game planned, it is stated in their FAQ that it will have a house edge</li>
                                <li>Edgeless claims their Blackjack game (not yet live) has a house edge of 0%, although this
                                only applies if every move and game played by a player is perfect</li>
                                <li>Although Edgeless is partially decentralized (on the blockchain), it is not peer to peer</li>
                                <li>Edgeless does not support ETH, only their own token, EDG</li>
                            </ul>

                                    To our knowledge, there is no other ethereum-based peer-to-peer dicing project. Etheroll
                                    is not peer-to-peer and has a house edge of 1% per roll. DAO.Casino is a protocol intended
                                    to allow casinos to operate on the blockchain easily, and thus has a different goal. Edgeless does
                                    not offer dicing with no house edge, and has stated their game will have one. Peerplays
                                    is not ethereum-based and has a much more general scope. For a detailed summary of notable

                                    with Ether. As the Ethbet protocol is easily adaptable and extendable, it can be
                                    adapted to work with arbitrary ERC20 tokens, which will allow users to bet with any other
                                    Ethereum-based token. This feature is technically possible and is currently planned.
